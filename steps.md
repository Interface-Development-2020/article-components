1. Scroll-to discussion
2. With a partner:
  - Using some of the information you know is available about the UI (left), plan a solution to the "Scroll to" challenge by drawing/writing the possible mechanics
  - Write a full paragraph explaining what you believe needs to be done
  - Critically analyze the possible downfalls/exception of your solution
  - Break the paragraph solution into a series of smaller steps (no code yet!!)
  - Check in with me
  - Begin testing single lines of code
  - Bring the code together into a solution 
3. I will see you to review:
  - Current task (Part 4: "slide to")
  - "heading bar" feature (Part 2)
  - "word count" feature (Part 3)
4. Project talk
